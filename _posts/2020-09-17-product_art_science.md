title: Product = Art + Science
---

I’ve come to realize that while being data driven is good, specially for removing cognitive biases, what’s equally important is to develop a strong *rigour* to differentiate between good and bad feedback. Not everything can be put into numbers and forcing a quantitative approach in every scenario may make you miss the big picture.

During product dev it’s easy to forget that at the end of the day every product will eventually hit the hands of a human user and solely focussing on metrics will never allow you to completely empathise with them. The process of creating a product is equally an art as it is a science. 

Art is difficult to define, at times it’s indescribable as it is ultimately the creative expression of an idea. Similarly when you have a deep understanding of your users and the problems you’re trying to solve for them, some ideas you have, may make absolutely zero sense given the data. However, the *rigour* you’ve developed gives you a gut feeling that’s it’s the right direction for your users and very often it turns out to be the differentiating factor - the core tenet defining why you built your product. 

Amazon Prime is an excellent example, an idea that didn’t really make sense on the balance sheet but was purely driven by Bezos’ instinct.

Product development is art + science, yin and yang, and the right place to be is at the centre.
