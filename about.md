## Whats a *Marinated Thought*?
An idea that has been garnished with some subconscious spices and left afar so that time does it’s job. Puns aside, I’ve learnt that some ideas just takes some time to go from a raw state to a fully formed concept. No amount of brainpower will help in that conversion, it just has to linger around in the subconscious space of our mind where it constantly gets processed and defragmented. You’ll notice that the next time you think about it perhaps some other neurons fire giving you a new perspective. 

This is more of a personal expierence and I’m not really sure why this happens - maybe something to do with spaced repetition? This blog is meant to be a collection of such thoughts.
